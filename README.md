# Investigating-Netflix-Movies-and-Guest-Stars-in-The-Office
Applying the Python skills by manipulating and visualizing movie and TV data.

## Project Description  
In this DataCamp project, I have apply the skills that I learned in Introduction to Python and Intermediate Python to solve a real-world data science problem. The idea is to to discover if Netflixâ€™s movies are getting shorter over time and which guest stars appear in the most popular episode of "The Office", using everything from lists and loops to pandas and matplotlib, while gaining experience in exploratory data analysis.
